## ðŸ”ƒWorking of project

- Login Controller

        - Initially Login Controller starts runs.
        - In web.xml, i have given the servlet mapping url pattern as (/) where in login Controller in get mapping index .jsp page navigates
        - After submitting the form in index.jsp again the login controller starts authentication

- Register Controller

        - There will be a register button in index.jsp after clicking it, register.jsp page works.
        - Once after submitting the register register controller runs where it will check validation for field required and password match.
        - Finally the index page navigates where the user can login now.

- Home Controller

        - After login, the datum in the workbence will  be stored in the list using home Dao.
        - I used the model.addattribute and set the list.
        - Now the page navigates to the home.jsp page where the list will be looped and displayed in the table.
